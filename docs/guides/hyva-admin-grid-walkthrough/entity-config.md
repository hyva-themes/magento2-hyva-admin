# Entity Config

This section of a Grid XML file simply supplies the name to render in the message when a grid contains no data.

```html
<entityConfig>
    <label>
        <singular>File</singular>
        <plural>Files</plural>
    </label>
</entityConfig>
```

This section is optional though, and if it is missing, the grid name is used to create a message.

In future more information might be added here.
