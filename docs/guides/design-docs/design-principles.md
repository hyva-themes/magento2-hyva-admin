# Design Principles

The purpose of Hyva_Admin is to empower developers to get work done efficiently and allow them to enjoy their work.

The module seeks to fulfill this purpose by using the following principles to guide development:

* Use defaults that allow accomplishing tasks with as little code as possible (good enough for 80% of all use cases).
* Create a system that leverages IDE/editor support as much as possible.
* Use existing, well understood technology like Layout XML, Blocks, XML merging, .phtml templates.
* Add extensibility for use cases that are understood without compromising usability (do not requires developers to create lots of code for simple use cases).
* Long Term Backward Compatibility: once an API aspect is released as stable it never changes. Only new features are added in a backward compatible manner.
* Make using Hyva_Admin fun.
