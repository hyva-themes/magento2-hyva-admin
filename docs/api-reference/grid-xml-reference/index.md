# Grid XML Reference

The nested documents describe the XML configuration for Hyva Admin grids.

When the configurations for a grid is loaded, it is merged from all modules, just like any other Magento 2 XML configuration file.

This allows customizing grids that are declared in other modules.

The API reference documents are sorted in alphabetical order.

If you want to read them all that’s fine, but if you only want to dip your toes into Hyva_Admin grids, I suggest you start with the [grid > source](source/index.md) configuration, followed by the [grid > columns > includes](columns/include/index.md) config.

Everything else can then be loaded into your brain when it is needed.

The grid XML schema may also be of interest - it can be found in the Hyvä_Admin module at `etc/hyva-grid.xsd`.
